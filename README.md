slothdiagram
============

A free diagram editor for Android. 


*This project has not yet been started, there is nothing to see here.*


This project's goal is to provide a fast and user friendly way of creating diagrams, flowcharts and
drafts on mobile tablet devices. In addition to the built­in features, the application should provide a
simple way to extend it by adding user-­created symbols and diagram types. Each symbol will
have its own set of properties which can be customized by the user (for instance: line/fill color or
border width).

Our main goal in terms of design is to provide a very efficient and natural user interface which
provides all necessary tools and settings while avoiding complicated nested menus. Input
focuses on natural gestures to make the workflow smooth and to minimize the effort needed to
create the desired result.
